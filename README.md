## An analysis of the relationship between body preferences and choice of sport

The data, stimuli, and analysis contained in this repo are a part of a research effort to understand if participation in sports
with different functional demands--running, rock climbing, and CrossFit--is associated with different body preferences. Specifically,
this research addresses whether female participants' ideal bodies (or ideal female partners, for men) vary in thinness (emaciation),
leanness (muscular detail), and muscularity (muscular size) between sports. 

Male and female participants answered questions about their sports participation and demographics then participanted in 
a body decision task. In this task, participants were asked to choose which of two bodies more closely resembled their
ideal body (or ideal body for a female partner, for men). In all decisions, one of the bodies had a baseline level
of emaciation, musuclar detail, and muscular size.

and the other body varied along these dimensions. 
After completing the body decision task, participants responded to survey questions to assess disordered eating,
drive for muscularity, drive for leanness, and functional versus asthetic body image values.

Results indicate that women who participate in CrossFit
